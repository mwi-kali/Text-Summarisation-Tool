# üì∞ Extractive & Abstractive News Summarisation with Sentiment Analysis

This repository includes a **News Summarisation Tool** that can handle both individual news articles and RSS feeds. It combines extractive and abstractive summarisation techniques to produce succinct summaries, as well as sentiment analysis to provide deeper insights into the text.

The project employs modern NLP models and technologies, making it an effective solution for rapidly digesting enormous amounts of news.

## üìå Key Features

### 1. Data retrieval and preprocessing

**Single Article Summarisation** retrieves and processes individual news articles with 'newspaper3k'.

**RSS Feed Summarisation** use 'feedparser' to get bulk articles from RSS feeds.

**Preprocessing** removes superfluous characters and noise from inputs to prepare them for summarisation.

### 2. Summarisation Techniques

**Extractive Summarization** uses the TextRank algorithm with 'Sumy' to extract key sentences from the source text.

**Abstractive Summary** creates human-like summaries with the pre-trained 'facebook/bart-large-cnn' model and Hugging Face's 'transformers' library. It divides large texts into digestible bits to efficiently deal with input size limits.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis 

It uses 'TextBlob' library to analyse sentiment in news articles. Sentiment polarity is returned as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

### 4. Front-End Interface 

It utilises HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5) and JavaScript to provide a modern and responsive user interface. Users can enter a single article URL or RSS feed link, view the extracted and abstract summaries and evaluate sentiment for individual articles and bulk RSS feeds.

### 5. Database Storage

Articles and summaries are saved to a SQLite database via 'SQLAlchemy' for future retrieval or analysis.
